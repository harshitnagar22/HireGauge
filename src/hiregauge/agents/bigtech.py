"""Big tech SWE agent (Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple).

Reviewed for modern hiring: DSA/coding and system design remain the primary technical
screens, balanced by demonstrated experience/impact, project quality, and behavioral/
leadership signal (heavily level-dependent), with a small pedigree/referral nudge.
