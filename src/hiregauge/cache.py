"""Tiny on-disk JSON cache for external API responses.

Keeps iteration cheap (and avoids hammering rate-limited APIs) during development.
Keys are arbitrary strings — collectors use ``"{source}:{identity}:{params}"``.

Each entry is wrapped in a small envelope that records ``fetched_at`` so reads can
enforce a **max age (TTL)**: external signals (GitHub stars, h-index, portfolios)
change over time, so an entry past its TTL is treated as a miss and refetched instead
of being scored silently. ``max_age=None`` opts an entry out of expiry (used for the
resume parse, which is keyed by content digest and never goes stale).

Three modes, set at construction:
- ``enabled=False`` — no reads, no writes (``--no-cache``).
- ``refresh=True`` — reads always miss but writes still happen, so the run refetches
  fresh data and rewrites the cache (``--refresh``).
- default — read fresh entries, refetch expired ones.
